**navbar linkeage works as of 4/6/2013 
     clicking on a link will open a new tab though, dont know if that is code issue or what


-finalize this version of navbar
-remove unnecessary files in /resources (put fancybox, js, slider into "/scripts/" folder)
-combine rules in stylesheets for banner and navbar into one file
-create working template that includes style.css, banner.php, navbar.html from /resources
-populate content files with what is done thusfar, keep track of progress for each page (in .txt file for each page?)
