If anyone thinks of anything that needs to be done, list
it here.
---------------STUFF THAT'S DONE---------------------------
(DONE) Have convert.py output a file named TableNames
    which contains the name of a table with a corresponding
    .csv file for each file generated by the convert.py
    script. 

    The importDatabase.php script should then read in the
    names of the tables into the $tableNames array by
    parsing the TableNames file.
    
    This way, should convert.py change to create
    more (or less) or differently named tables, the 
    importDatabase.php script will not have to be edited
    in any way.
