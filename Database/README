Conventions:
	(1) When naming columns in the database :
		Use camel case and include capitalization of the first letter
			e.g. (FirstName, LastName, IsMentor,...)
		Non-boolean values do NOT begin with the word 'Is'
		Boolean values begin with the word 'Is' 
			e.g. (IsMentor, IsMentee, IsInMatchResult)
		NOTE: Failure to follow the boolean naming convention will
		      result in non-user friendly output from the functions
		      in excelFunction.php. For instance, the client would
		      like to see "YES" and "NO" in the excel spreadsheet
		      instead of "TRUE" and "FALSE" or "1" and "0" in the
		      spreadsheet. Following this convention allows the php
		      code to correctly modify the data in the database to
		      be represented as the client desires.
